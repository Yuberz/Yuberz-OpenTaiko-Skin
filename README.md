# Yuberz's OpenTaiko Skin

This is a fork of [Mohshir's Opentaiko Skin](https://github.com/MoshirMoshir/Moshir-OpenTaiko-Skin). It is currently functional as of OpenTaiko Version 0.6.0.6.

## Notice
If any assets are used from this fork, I would prefer for credit to be attributed. Some of the assets are handmade, so I would appreciate the credit! Also, I would NOT recommend using this commercially or on streams. This is only for private use.
Do NOT link this repository in the OpenTaiko discord server or anything affiliated with OpenTaiko. It is FORBIDDEN and any potential bans regarding this are not my responsibility. This skin is NOT affiliated with the OpenTaiko project or any of its developers.

## Installation
1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Yuberz/Yuberz-OpenTaiko-Skin/releases).
2. Extract it to the same directory as OpenTaiko.exe (NOT OpenTaiko-Hub.exe), it should match the file structure accurately. If it asks to overwrite, overwrite.
3. Open OpenTaiko and switch the skin!

## Additional Installation Notes
- This installation will replace the default hitsounds with ones from TaikoNijiroDondaEX. It can be changed in the instrument selection menu.
- This uses a different font than Mohshir's and is a NON-STANDARD taiko font. It's my personal preference, but it's also possible to change the font by editing SkinConfig.ini and adding the font to the fonts folder.
